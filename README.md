Express and JQuery In Class
Goals:

Module Pattern
Document Ready
Jade
JQuery and DOM basics
JSON and Lists
Step 01: Create
Create a new express app:

express Week02-ExpressJQuery
cd Week02-ExpressJQuery
npm install
Open up your project in WebStorm.

Open bin/www. Set the port to 30025. In package.json, plug in nodemon instead of node. Set the title in routes/index.js to some string that contains your last name.

Step 02: Control.js
In the public/javascripts folder create a JavaScript file called Control.js.

Put the following code in Control.js:


var MyObject = (function() {

    function MyObject() {
    }

    MyObject.prototype.readyCalled = function() {
        $("#readyCalled").html("Ready was called and myObjected created");
    };

    return MyObject;
}());


$(document).ready(function() {
    var myObject = new MyObject();
    myObject.readyCalled();
});
Step Three: Layout
Bower is like npm. Use NPM for server side code. Use Bower for client side code. This is not absolutely necessary, but it is common. As a result, we will learn about both NPM and Bower in this class.

Install Bower:

npm install -g bower
Create a bower.json file in the root of your current project:

bower init
You will be prompted for input. Take all the defaults or use your common sense to fill in the fields as you are prompted for them.

Remember that Windows does not like to start a file with a period. As a result, we need to create .bowerrc like this:

echo { } > .bowerrc
Edit .bowerrc in geany and add the following so that we will install bower components into the public/components directory:

{
  "directory": "public/components",
  "json": "bower.json"
}
Again, test in jsonlint.com to make sure it is valid.

Install jquery:

bower install jquery --save
The --save parameter saves your request for jquery into the bower.json file.

My bower.json file now looks like this:

{
  "name": "Week02-ExpressJQuery",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "authors": [
    "Charlie CedarIsle Calvert <charlie@elvenware.com>"
  ],
  "description": "JQuery Demo",
  "main": "bin/www",
  "keywords": [
    "JQuery"
  ],
  "license": "MIT",
  "homepage": "www.elvenware.com",
  "ignore": [
    "**/.*",
    "node_modules",
    "bower_components",
    "test",
    "tests"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "jquery": "~2.1.3"
  }
}
The most important part is the dependencies object at the end of the file.

Modify /views/layout.jade to include jquery and Control.js

doctype html
html
    head
        title= title
        link(rel='stylesheet', href='/stylesheets/style.css')
        script(src='components/jquery/dist/jquery.js')
        etc...
NOTE: When I type etc..., that can sometimes be translated as: "Filling in this part of the file is left as an exercise for the reader."

Step Four: Jade
In index.jade use Jade to create a button and two paragraphs:

button#sendString Send String
p#stringHolder
p#readyCalled
Add a button to index.jade with an id of sendString. Use the constuctor of MyObject to set up a handler for the button click. Create a private method of MyObject called stringSender that places a string in your stringHolder paragraph.

When the user clicks on the button a method must be called. To make the possible, add code in the constructor that defines an event handler for the button click and method to handle the event:

    function MyObject() {
        $('#sendString').click(showString);
    }

    function showString() {
        $('#stringHolder').html('Send string was clicked');
    }
NOTE: The above code should appear in Control.js. As a rule, it makes no sense to place JavaScript code in a Jade file. The purpose of a Jade file is to create HTML. It is not a place for, or a means of creating, JavaScript.

Step Five: Lists
Create ul element in your index.jade:

ul#myList
Add a button:

button#getItems Get Items
In Control.js we handle the button click like this:

function MyObject() {
    $('#getItems').click(showItems);
}
In Control.js we add items to the list with this showItems method:

function showItems() {
    $("#myList").append('<li>' + 'item01' + '</li>');
    $("#myList").append('<li>' + 'item02' + '</li>');
    $("#myList").append('<li>' + 'item03' + '</li>');
}
Step Six: Add Marie
Add a marie button to index.jade:

button#getMarie Get Marie
Handle it like this in Control.js:

function MyObject() {
    $('#sendString').click(showString);
    $('#getItems').click(showItems);
    $('#getMarie').click(showMarie);
}
Inside the showMarie method create a JavaScript object that follows the rules of JSON:

var marie = {
    "firstName": "Marie",
    "lastName": "Curie",
    "city": "Paris",
    "country": "France"
};
Cut and paste the curly braces and the syntax between them into jsonlint.com to be sure it is valid JSON:

{
    "firstName": "Marie",
    "lastName": "Curie",
    "city": "Paris",
    "country": "France"
}
Now inside showMarie iterate over the items and add them to your list:

for (var property in marie) {
    if (marie.hasOwnProperty(property)) {
        $("#myList").append('<li>' + marie[property] + '</li>');        
    }
}
Turn it in
Place the contents of your project in your repository in a folder called Week02-ExpressJQuery.

When you make the submission remind me of the URL of your repository and specify the folder in your repository where the project resides.

When I open the folder that contains your project, I should see the code for your project, not another folder that contains the code.

Good:

.../Git/prog219-lastname/Week02-ExpressjQuery/package.json
Not so good:

.../Git/prog219-lastname/Week02-ExpressjQuery/ExpressProject/package.json
